## Summary

**Total Tests: 38**
**Passed: 38**
**Failed: 0**
**Success Rate: 100%**

The comprehensive test suite demonstrates that the system separation has been successfully implemented. All core requirements (1.1, 1.2, 4.3) have been verified through extensive testing covering:

1. **Independence**: Game systems operate completely independently of graphics
2. **Interface Compliance**: All systems implement proper abstractions
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling without cross-system impact
4. **Performance**: Maintained efficiency across separated systems
5. **Data Processing**: Complete data flow independence
6. **Integration**: Proper system coordination while maintaining separation

The architecture successfully separates concerns between game logic and graphics rendering, enabling independent development, testing, and maintenance of each subsystem.
